clandestiny
===========

rendezvous hashing implementation based on murmur3 hash


## motiviation

in distributed systems, the need often arises to locate objects amongst a
cluster of machines. consistent hashing and rendezvous hashing are methods of
performing this task, while minimizing data movement on cluster topology
changes.

clandestiny is a library for rendezvous hashing which has the goal of simple
clients and ease of use.
